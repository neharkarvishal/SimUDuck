 * Unchanged from version 2. No need to implement Flyable or Quackable here. But
 * what about swim(). DecoyDuck objects don't really swim, after all they aren't
 * alive. Therefore, shouldn't they float? We still suffer from implementation
 * inheritance. However, notice that we do not implement the Flyable or
 * Quackable interfaces because DecoyDuck objects don't fly or quack. So at
 * least now we have some control of how our classes work.
